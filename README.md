**Hello, my name is SMR.**<br>
**I'm a QML/C++ programmer.**
- I'm presently working on the [Knight Pen](https://github.com/SMR76/knight-pen) and [Car Alarm](https://github.com/SMR76/Car_Alarm) projects.
- I'd want to learn how to program an ARM microcontroller.
- You may contact me by sending an [email](mailto:seyyedmortezarazavi76@gmail.com).
